My Website is a church website .My local church doesnt have a website so I decided id make them one.Church members and the public can find information and submit requests using the website.
There are four html pages:
	Index.html-This is the homepage.I put a couple of iframe youtube videos from the church youtube page and information on church programs
	prayer.html-This page allows users to submit their prayer requests in a form.Although it doest really submit to any database.
	Contacts.html-Contains information on how to contact the church.It also has a form that allows the user to send a feedback messege
	about.html-The page has information about the church and its fundermental beliefs.
	tassia.css-contains styling used in the html files.Not all styles are included since I used bootsrap4.
	variables.scss-contains scss variables, instances of scss nesting and inheritance
